# Atom One Dark by Sitects – IntelliJ Theme

A modern IntelliJ theme inspired by the original **Atom One Dark** color palette.  
This plugin adapts the now-discontinued [One Dark theme by mfwebstudio](https://github.com/mfwebstudio/atom-one-dark-by-mayke-public) for use in JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, PHPStorm, and others).

## Introduction

**Sitects One Dark** brings a balanced, high-contrast look to your IntelliJ-based IDE. It is inspired by the popular Atom One Dark color scheme, ensuring:

- Easily distinguishable syntax highlighting
- Visually pleasing UI components
- A comfortable coding experience

This project is derived from the [“One Dark” theme by mfwebstudio](https://github.com/mfwebstudio/atom-one-dark-by-mayke-public), which has been discontinued. We’ve carried forward its design approach while updating styles for modern IntelliJ builds.

## Features

- **Subtle Background**: Dark yet consistent background for minimal eye strain.
- **Distinct Syntax Highlighting**: Easily distinguishable colors for strings, keywords, constants, etc.
- **UI Integration**: Custom colors for tool windows, dialogs, and sidebars for a cohesive environment.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimal overhead, focusing purely on color changes without additional dependencies.
